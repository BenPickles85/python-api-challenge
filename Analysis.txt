1) With both r values around 0.6, there is a moderately strong correlation between temperature and latitude in both hemishperes. 
Although there does appear to be a greater range in temperatures between -25 and -10 degrees latitude, futher analysis would be
required to confirm if this is in fact the case. From running multiple versions, this has not always been the case so 
I am wary of reading to much into this. Although it is apparent that temperatures at the poles are on avergae cooler than at the
equator, other factors such as altitude and proximity to the ocean also have an impact and limit the latitude/temperature 
relationship from being stronger. 

2) With r values under 0.01 there is no correltaion between humidity and latitude. However, it is apparent that for latitudes
under -40 and above 55 degrees, there are no humidities under 40%. This could make sense as cold air has a lesser aility to 
retain mositure. To investigate this I ran temp vs humidity and although there was more of a correlation, particularly
in the northern hemisphere which had an r value = 0.2, any relationship is still a very weak relationship. 

3) With r values = 0.05 or under, their does not appear to be a cvorrelation between cloudiness and latitude. However, what is
observale, particularly for the northern hemisphere plot, is a tendency for either no cloud or full cloud,rather than all data
points beng evenly dispersed. For cities with no cloud, these appear to mostly be situated between latitudes between -20 and
-40 and 25 and 50 degrees. My thoughts on this are that the greater landmasses are situated between these ranges of latitude
with more inland areas which would be less prone to cloudiness. However, again, further analysis would be required to confirm
this hypothesis.
